Awareness and visibility of Chalmers’ activities in the international research community \\ncan be created in several different ways, ranging from publications and exchanges to stays abroad. \\nInternational attractiveness can enable Chalmers to recruit talented, motivated, driven individuals and attract international partners, while ensuring that we can retain the people whose expertise can build a strong position and boost our contribution to the world.  \\nAvailability and cost of energy, products and materials  \\nThe events of recent years, with growing geopolitical uncertainty, an increasingly strained international economy, deteriorating economic conditions and changes in logistics and trade networks, have increased the risk of significant cost increases for crit ical parts of our research and \\neducation infrastructure. These include soaring energy and media prices, as well as both increased \\ncosts and shortages of certain materials, components or instruments es sential to our operations.  \\nSecurity, corruption and irregularities  \\nThe rapidly changing geopolitical situation with a tense international situation has given rise to \\nincreased risks of intrusion, espionage, various types of attack or assault, and universities like Chalmers with internationally recognised cutting -edge research and advanced technological \\ndevelopment are in a particularly vulnerable position. The openness of the academic world and the \\naccessibility and democratic values of Swedish society require special awareness and v igilance so that \\nwe can both protect and develop both these values and other values that exist and are created. If \\nthis issue is not managed properly and in a balanced way, there is a risk that either fundamental \\nvalues or economic values and competitive advantages will be lost.

The President decides every year whether to create positions to be advertised or for internal and direct recruitment.  Advertised positions must be described in broad terms with a well-defined, clear requirements profile so that they are accessible and perceived as attractive by both external and internal candidates. In addition to a description of the position, the requirements profile must include a plan for the search process and an estimate of the expected number of candidates. The estimated gender distribution of the pool of candidates must also be presented. The outcome of the search processes is monitored by the Faculty Appointment Committee during the recruitment process.  According to a decision by the President, at least one male and one female applicant must be invited to an interview when recruiting to advertised positions within the faculty (C 2019-1034). If the pool of candidates is single-sex and/or has only internal applicants, the chair of the Faculty Appointment Committee has the right to refer the matter back to the department for action. Such a decision may be appealed against to the President. Only in exceptional cases, and with a strong motivation, is it possible to appoint someone to a position with few qualified candidates, with a one-sided gender distribution or with just internal candidates. With “internal candidate” means a candidate that holds a position at Chalmers.   The Faculty Appointment Committee makes a recommendation on the appointment after examining the case. The President then decides on the appointment of all positions at the levels of professor and full professor',\n",

Decision taken by the President \\non 2021 -06-23. \\nWork tasks  \\nTasks that the employee is to perform remotely should be of the same nature as those normally performed at the main workplace and/or tasks that the employer and the employee jointly define as \\nsuitable for remote work. Objectives for t he tasks and how these are to be monitored must also be \\ndefined. Employees’ ability to perform their tasks remotely varies depending on their job. It is the \\nemployer who ultimately decides which tasks can be performed remotely. Tasks with potentially risky  elements, such as hazardous laboratory work, may not be carried out remotely.  \\n\\nScope  \\nRemote work must be arranged in such a way that it does not interfere with work in general, and the \\nemployee must physically participate in meetings at the workplace when needed. Remote work is \\ngoverned by the needs of the organisation.  \\nFrom the Agreement  on Working Hours for Teaching and Research Staff at Chalmers: Lecturers and \\ndoctoral students must be available in the workplace to the extent required by the activities and \\ntasks in which they are involved. If the work permits, it may be agreed that invo lved tasks can be \\ntransferred to a place other than the regular workplace.  \\nFrom the Agreement on Salary and Employment Conditions for Employees at Chalmers: For lecturers, researchers, doctoral students, and certain other employees  non-regulated working h ours  normally \\napply. This means that they can carry out their work freely in terms of time and space if it does not \\nimpede operational considerations. Working hours must be planned in consultation with the \\nlecturer/employee concerned,  based on the requirem ents of the activity in question and an overall \\nview of the lecturer’s/employee’s tasks and general work situation during the year. The consultation  \\nshould lead to an overall plan for the scope and organisation of the lecturer’s duties during the semester or academic year. N on-regulated working hours  are regulated against annual working hours \\nin accordance with the applicable agreement.  \\nUnless otherwise agreed, remote work under these guidelines may be applied up to two days a week \\nfor staff with regulated working hours.  \\nIn case of national obligations or by decision of the President, other arrangements may apply, for \\nexample in circumstances where remote work is advisable to a greater degree.  \\n\\nAvailability and working hours  \\nAccording to the applic able agreement.',\n",

There is also a high variation in how long it takes for research findings and knowledge to have an impact in society in various subject areas and research fields.   Chalmers’ researchers and teachers are expected to work with external parties to contribute to utilisation of our research findings and our knowledge. However, they are not responsible for all the steps that lead to the impact.  Qualifications in utilisation may be divided into four main areas, see below. The qualifications may be assigned different weightings, depending on the requirements for the specific position or for local activities.  • Actively making research findings visible to raise public knowledge of how science and research can contribute to good societal development.  • Advice to decision-makers in the private, public and non-profit sectors. • Participation in the public debate and opinion-forming based on fundamental academic values that can be seen to contribute to good societal development.  • The ability to contribute to an impact in society as research findings and knowledge give rise to new innovations, methods, products, processes, treatments, codes, behaviours, industry standards, services and companies.   \\t4.4\\tAcademic\\tcitizenship\\tAcademic citizenship involves work that goes beyond ordinary teaching and research. It may be defined as commitments and activities that contribute to a well-functioning academic environment and collegial activities at the department, the home university and within academia outside the home university.  Academic citizenship may be divided into three main areas: collegiality, tasks in academia within and outside one’s home university (institutional service) and leadership. Collegiality is essential for a good internal environment, to which all Chalmers co-workers are expected to contribute.

Alcohol \\nand drugs do not belong in the workplace or study environment. Alcohol consumption or drug \\nmisuse during work or study time is not allowed at Chalmers, and any use during leisure time must \\nnot affect safety, working capacity or well-being in the workplace. \\n\\nEveryone who works or studies at Chalmers is responsible for compliance with our alcohol and drugs \\npolicy.

Direct recruitment means that a position is not advertised. It is offered to a specific external person of strategic importance to Chalmers who meets the given requirements profile.   Direct recruitment is applied very restrictively to permanent positions, and they may only take place if it is in line with operational needs and Chalmers’ and the department’s strategic plans. A prerequisite is that the candidate is deemed to be excellent. For direct recruitment to full professor or research professor, excellence means that the candidate is a highly regarded internationally leading researcher and research leader. A full professor must also be a skilled educator in their field.    Where direct recruitment is requested, the department’s research committee will conduct an initial internal review of the candidate. The President decides on all direct recruitment. Direct recruitment always requires scientific expert assessment, plus an educational review if teaching is part of the position. The Faculty Appointment Committee manages the recruitment process, including the review of the candidate’s qualifications, in accordance with established procedures.   Direct recruitment to the position of assistant professor with tenure track is possible if individuals have received a highly competitive individual funding. A highly competitive individual funding means the equivalent of examples such as the Swedish Research Council’s Starting Grant, Wallenberg Academy Fellow and ERC Starting Grants, i.e.. the funding is applied for as an individual, there are a large number of applications, with a success rate of around 10-20%, and the funding is adequate for at least three years. The chair of the Faculty Appointment Committee assesses which funding is deemed to be sufficiently competitive',\n",

       "  'Starting points for operations  \\nExternal environment and current status  \\nOver the past two hundred years, technological progress has made a decisive contribution to a better \\nlife for humankind. However, it is that same technological development that is in many ways responsible for the serious situation in which our planet now finds itself. The historically difficult challenges we and our planet are now facing demand bold, new, long- term responses. Much of the \\nresponsibility for resolving these problems lies with autonomous higher education institutions that \\nhave academic freedom  and provide high -quality education and research.  \\nWe live in a globalised society in which knowledge and human behaviour can move quickly and \\ninfluence other people around the world. Sweden as a country of knowledge and innovation (and \\nthus Chalmers) therefore has an increasingly important role to play in  changing the world. One \\nobvious area is the green transition towards a fossil- free society. At the same time, digitisation is \\ndominating much of our lives, and the growing presence of artificial intelligence is having both positive and negative effects. A nother change concerns the democratic welfare state. Internal and \\nexternal forces and a changing security situation in Europe and the world are threatening the society we in Sweden have long taken for granted.

For courses that are open for registration and may have participants from several employers, no separate contracts are generally entered into, but the general terms and conditions set out in connection with registration for the course apply.  • Health and safety responsibility: The organisation that has decided on a course instance (see point 1) has health and safety responsibility for the participants on these courses, in line with principle 1. • Teacher involvement: Management of departments always decide on their teachers’ involvement in courses and are responsible for ensuring sufficient human resources, in line with principles 4 and 7. This also applies to courses provided by a centre or Tracks in agreement with a department; see point 1. • Marketing: The organisation that has decided on a course instance (see point 1) is responsible for the information when marketing courses, including that the recommended prior knowledge is clearly described, in line with principle 2. • Finance: The organisation that has decided on a course instance (see point 1) determines the participants’ fees in accordance with the principle of full cost coverage, in line with principle 5. Revenue from courses goes directly to the organisation that has decided on a course instance, which also bears all costs, including for teachers and administration.   • Agreement with the educational area: The maximum level of financial sales from education in a calendar year for a department, including for all its centres (without exception), is determined in an annual agreement between the department and the educational area for lifelong learning, in line with principle 6.

       "  'Other paid education differs from contract education in that it is arranged for a fee by a natural person without the involvement of a client/employer. This education may not provide higher education credits. The courses are open to individuals to enrol and pay a participation fee. The courses may be freestanding or combined with other programmes. Chalmers provides other paid education only in the field of shipping, in which the content and learning objectives of the courses are regulated to provide qualifications and certificates in accordance with the Swedish Transport Agency’s regulations (TSFS 2011:166). Education in the field of shipping may also take the form of contract education in cases in which the client/employer pays for the education and may, in these cases, provide higher education credits. Principles The following principles apply to contract education and other paid education at Chalmers. Participants: 1. Participants on courses are not considered students and are not members of the Chalmers Student Union.  2. Participants’ prior knowledge is generally not reviewed by Chalmers. It is the clients who decide which individuals should have an opportunity for education. However, there may be exceptions and the Chalmers Admission and Examination Unit can assist in reviewing prior knowledge for courses with higher education credits in response to requests from the organisations deciding on courses (see the section on organisation and responsibility).  Courses offered: 3. The courses offered must be within Chalmers’ areas of expertise and preferably be in subject areas and at an educational level where Chalmers can make a difference, i.e. where Chalmers can contribute in a way that other education providers cannot. This means that courses at second-cycle level will be prioritised in many cases. 4. The education may not be conducted in such a way or to such an extent that it has a negative impact on the quality and implementation of Chalmers’ higher education programmes. Examples of negative impact include limited teaching resources and students’ opportunities for learning and examination on courses that are combined with other programmes. Finance: 5. Participation fees should be calculated to cover all costs, which includes direct costs and a reasonable share of indirect costs',\n",

These guidelines are to provide support and clarify the responsibilities of the employer and the employee, to explain the circumstances surrounding remote working, which may have consequences \\nfor issues such as insurance coverage and the w ork environment, and to ensure equal treatment in \\nthe management of remote work when such work is possible.  \\n\\nDefinition  \\nRemote work is the practice of employees doing their jobs from a location other than their regular \\nworkplace. Such locations could inclu de an employee’s home, a co -working space, a private office, or \\nany other place outside of campus. Remote work at Chalmers entails working within the borders of \\nSweden. Working remotely is never an obligation, but neither is it a right. Remote work is base d on \\nmutual trust between the employer and the employee and should be seen as an option if the nature and requirements of the work tasks allow it and it can meet the interests and needs of both Chalmers and its employees. Chalmers campus is the employee’s main workplace and place of employment.  \\n\\nApplication  \\nThese guidelines apply to all staff at Chalmers University of Technology, both employees with non -\\nregulated working hours  and those with regulated working hours.  The guidelines , however , do not \\nrestrict Chalmers’ collective agreements (the Agreement on Salary and Employment Conditions for Employees at Chalmers or the Agreement on Working Hours for Teaching and Research Staff at \\nChalmers), and the application of the guidelines will therefo re be different for staff with non -\\nregulated working hours  and staff with regulated working hours. The guidelines do not change the \\nterms and conditions of Chalmers’ working time agreements,  neither  for regulated working hours  nor \\nfor non-regulated working  hours .',\n",

       "  '15.2 Recruitment to advertised positions within the faculty  \\nThe procedure for recruitment to an advertised position at Chalmers is described in \\nChalmers’ guidelines for staff recruitment, C 2018 -0425. The President decides every year \\nwhether to create positi ons to be advertised or for internal and direct recruitment.  \\n Advertised positions must be described in broad terms with a well -defined, clear \\nrequirements profile so that they are accessible and perceived as attractive by both external and internal candidates. In addition to a description of the position, the requirements profile must include a plan for the search process and an estimate of the expected number of candidates. The estimated gender distribution of the pool of candidates must also be presented . The outcome of the search processes is monitored  by the Faculty Appointment \\nCommittee during the recruitment process.  \\n According to a decision by the President, at least one male and one female applicant  must \\nbe invited to an interview when recruiting to advertised positions within the faculty ( C \\n2019- 1034). If the pool of candidates is single -sex and/or has only internal applicants, the \\nchair of the Faculty Appointment Committee has the right to refer th e matter back to the \\ndepartment for action. Such a decision may be appealed against to the President. Only in exceptional cases, and with a strong motivation, is it possible to appoint someone to a \\nposition with few qualified candidates, with a one -sided g ender distribution or with just \\ninternal candidates . With “i nternal candidate” means a candidate that holds a position at \\nChalmers.  \\n\\nThe Faculty Appointment Committee makes a recommendation on the appointment after examining the case. The President then d ecides on the appointment of all positions at the \\nlevel s of professor  and full professor . The head of department decides on the appointment \\nof positions below the level of professor.  \\n\\n15.3 Promotion  \\nThe Faculty Appointment Committee handles promotions of teaching and research faculty . \\nPromotion means that a person employed in a position governed by the rules of procedure \\nis offered, after consideration, a more qualified teaching/research position in the same category, provided that the co -worker  meets the requirements for qualifications for the \\nhigher position. The qualifications for promotion must be the same as those for external recruitment to an equivalent position. Promotion must be in line with Chalmers’ and  the \\ndepartment’s strategic plan and there must be adequate long -term funding for the position.',\n",

Thus, on\\nmultiple occasions, the supervisor(s) together with the examiner and Director of Studies should have\\ntried in different ways to help the doctoral student to conduct their studies as specified in the\\nindividual study plan, e.g. through revisions of the individual study plan, extra supervisor support or\\nchange of supervisor. The withdrawal of resources for a doctoral student should be the last resort\\nafter all possible solutions have been exhausted.\\nThe individual study plan is the most important document for the doctoral student’s individual\\ndoctoral studies. There must be adequate documentation on progression and supportive measures\\nimplemented in order for a decision on the withdrawal of resources to be made. It is therefore\\nimportant to have a clear and detailed individual study plan that is followed up regularly.\\n9.2 Significance of withdrawing supervision and other resources\\nA decision to withdraw resources for a doctoral student means, among other things, that supervisor\\nresources, workplace, computer, phone and email address, access to laboratory space and\\nequipment, and access to other teaching resources are all withdrawn.\\nA doctoral student whose resources have been withdrawn does not lose their place in the doctoral\\nprogramme at Chalmers. The doctoral student has the right to apply to publicly defend their thesis\\nor present their licentiate thesis at a licentiate seminar. If the doctoral student wishes to end their\\nstudies, for example to pursue opportunities in the labour market, they must submit a request to\\nwithdraw from the programme.\\n9.3 Impact on doctoral employment and other financial support upon withdrawal of\\nresources\\nResources may not be withdrawn during the time period the doctoral student has doctoral\\nemployment.

Decision by Vice \\nPresident of Undergraduate Education and Lifelong learning \\n113.2.2. Assessment of presentation and opposition\\nThe assessment of the student’s performance in presentation and opposition is combined \\nwith the individual grade achieved so far. The final grade can be affected if the individual \\ngrade borders on a higher or lower grade. This means that, taken together, performance in \\npresentation and opposition can affect the grade by at most +- 1/2 of a grade level. Read \\nmore in annexes 5 and 6.\\n3.2.3. Other supporting information for assessment of the individual’s performance\\nThe supervisor is free to have the members of the group make oral and also written \\nassessments of their own and the other group members’ performance in addition to what is \\nmade in the project diary and contribution report. Such assessments can help the supervisor \\nand examiner to set the individual grades. However, it is not the students who set grades \\nand for that reason there is no part of formal point assessment in the organization of the \\nexamination.\\n3.2.4. Failed individual performance and supplement\\nA student in a group can be failed even when the group as a whole is passed if the \\ncontribution report, the project diary and the supervisor’s assessment are in agreement that \\nthe student concerned does not meet the performance requirements. The most common \\nreason for failing a student is that the student has not participated in the work to the extent \\nexpected. The student who has been failed can come back in a new project in a later run of \\nthe course.\\nTo be passed each student must carry out the oral presentation and discussion. The course \\nmemo states how a student can report an acute valid reason for not carrying this out. In the \\ncase of a valid reason, the department has to give the student the opportunity to \\nsupplement their presentation and opposition before the end of the retake period in August. \\nA student who does not do their supplement is failed on the course.\\n3.3. Feedback about base grades and individual grades\\nThe examiner is responsible for the students being given feedback about base grades and \\nindividual grades. The examiner can delegate this to the supervisor. The supervisor is \\nresponsible for giving feedback about the individual’s contribution to the group’s process, \\ncollaboration and results\",\n",

It means that, as a university of technology and science, our mission is to produce, maintain and spread knowledge, expertise and solutions to achieve an open, sustainable society in Sweden and worldwide. To succeed in achieving our objectives, it is essential for Chalmers to attract highly motivated students, with good prior knowledge, and outstanding teachers and researchers. We achieve this by offering world-class education, research environments and infrastructure that promote excellent research at a high international level and unique opportunities for sustainable utilisation of our research findings and knowledge.   The high quality of our academic and operational activities is largely based on the recruitment of qualified staff at all levels. Chalmers’ recruitment process therefore plays a central role in ensuring that Chalmers can continue to develop as a successful higher education institution.    Chalmers’ faculty is a driving force for the creation of courageous, long-term initiatives in research, education and utilisation and has great responsibility for Chalmers’ development. This responsibility must be maintained across all tasks, qualifications and the overall assessment for both recruitment and promotion.   1.2\\tChalmers’\\tAppointment\\tRegulations\\tThe rules of procedure correspond to the rules that apply to public higher education institutions as a result of the legislation such as the Higher Education Act and the Higher Education Ordinance. The rules of procedure are adopted by the Board of Chalmers University of Technology AB. The President is authorised to make decisions on updating the rules of procedure.

Departments, including centres and Tracks A department is the organisational unit at Chalmers that primarily provides contract education and other paid education. The overall responsibility for the education rests with the management of the department. The centres hosted by the institution are also part of this responsibility. The management of the department must ensure that the education complies with the principles that apply to such education, and the bullet list below shows what this means. Exceptions are made for those centres with mission statements clearly stating that they have specific authority in relation to their host departments, and what this may entail is set out in the bullet list below.

Tracks also keeps the educational area for lifelong learning informed about course quality. • Practical administration: The organisation that has decided on a course instance is responsible for the practical administration of the education, in line with principle 10. Educational area for lifelong learning (referred to subsequently as the educational area) The Dean of Education has overall responsibility for ensuring that Chalmers’ contract education and other paid education in shipping complies with Chalmers’ principles for this education as follows: • External inquiries: The educational area is a possible entry point for external inquiries about education and refers them to the relevant departmental management or Tracks management, in line with principle 3. The educational area can assist with dialogues with potential clients and tenders, quotations, contracts, etc. • Marketing: The educational area can provide some assistance with the marketing of courses. • Financial sales: The educational area ensures that the planned total financial sales for contract education and other paid education in shipping do not jeopardise Chalmers’ tax status as a higher education institution, in line with principle 6. The educational area enters into annual agreements with the management of departments, and Tracks, on the maximum financial sales for education for the coming calendar year for each department, including all its centres. • Quality: The Dean of Education is responsible for the quality of courses with higher education credits and therefore decides on the creation of new courses with higher education credits following requests from department managers (including for courses provided by their centres, without exception) and based on quality requirements for syllabuses. This does not apply to the courses provided by Tracks, where decisions are made by the management of Tracks.

Presentation and opposition \\nThe department is responsible for scheduling the presentation of its bachelor's theses. The \\npresentation and opposition take place at the end of study period 4, the week before the \\nexamination week. Opposition is mainly held of bachelor's theses carried out at the same \\ndepartment. However, departments with few bachelor's theses can coordinate with other \\ndepartments that have bachelor's theses aimed at the same programme or subject area. In \\naddition to the presenting group and the opponents, the examiners of the presenting and \\nopposing groups also attend, preferably along with the supervisor of the presenting group.\\nTo be given an individual assessment all students have to participate actively in the \\npresentation and opposition. Groups that have four or more members are therefore divided \\nup into two presentation sessions (the students are divided up into two sub-groups; each \\nsub-group presents the whole project), while groups with three or fewer members are given \\none presentation session.\\nEach reporting session is 30 minutes; this period has to accommodate the presentation (15-\\n20 min), opposition and any questions from the examiner and other participants. An \\nopposition is held directly after each oral presentation. The opposing group (sub-group) have \\n10 minutes for their opposition.\\nSince the opposition is assessed individually and the time for oral opposition is short, each \\nstudent also has to write an individual opposition. The students in the opposing (sub-)group \\nhave each to submit their written opposition to their examiner, their supervisor, the \\npresenting group and the presenting group’s supervisor at least three working days before \\nthe first presentation date (the exact date is given on Chalmers Education pages for bachelor \\ntheses). There is more information on presentation and opposition in annexes 5 and 6. \\n3. Examination \\nThe bachelor’s thesis course is graded on an individual basis.

This means \\nthat, as an independent university foundation, Chalmers needs to incorporate the contents of statutes \\nsuch as the Higher Education Ordinance in its own regulations. These regulations have been drawn up to \\nestablish the  forms and guidelines for student influence.  \\nChalmers’ special position as an independent university foundation has also enabled it to decide that all \\nChalmers students must belong to Chalmers Student Union.

A prerequisite is that the candidate is deemed to be excellent. For direct recruitment to full professor or research professor, excellence means that the candidate is a highly regarded internationally leading researcher and research leader. A full professor must also be a skilled educator in their field.    \\n Where direct recruitment is requested, the department’s research committee will conduct an initial internal review of the candidate. The President decides on all direct recruitment. Direct recruitment always requires scientific expert assessment, plus an educational review if teaching is part of the position. The Faculty Appointment C ommittee manages the \\nrecruitment process, including the review of the candidate’s qualifications, in accordance with established procedures.   Direct recruitment to the position of assistant professor with tenure track is possible if individuals have recei ved a highly competitive individual funding. A highly competitive \\nindividual funding means  the equivalent of examples such as the Swedish Research \\nCouncil’s Starting Grant, Wallenberg Academy Fellow and ERC Starting Grants, i.e .. the \\nfunding is applied for  as an individual, there are a large number of applications, with a \\nsuccess rate of around 10 -20%, and the funding is adequate for at least three years. The \\nchair of the Faculty Appointment Committee assesses which funding is deemed to be sufficiently comp etitive. In these cases, the candidate does not need to undergo further \\nscientific review by external experts. However, they must give a lecture and be interviewed by the Faculty Appointment Committee based on Chalmers’ assessment criteria and qualificatio ns for the position. Please note that it is also the case with direct recruitment \\nthat the recruiting department/area of advance must make a joint effort to provide funds to meet the resource requirements for the assistant professor’s activities.',\n",

The positions are described based on the qualifications required and the duties that are expected to be included.   The purpose of adjunct positions is to broaden the university’s expertise in research, education and utilisation by increasing the interaction and collaboration with industry and society. Through adjuncts, Chalmers gains access to specialist expertise and experience from outside the academic sphere.   The candidate for an adjunct position must have achieved the equivalent degree of scientific or artistic proficiency, demonstrated by technical/professional activity during their career, as is expected within academia at the level of the position concerned.  The same expectations also apply to the candidate’s contribution to the development of the field of study in question, the candidate’s leadership experience and the supervision of co-workers. Adjunct professors must also have achieved international standing to the same extent as one would expect of a professor in their academic discipline.   In fields in which both scientific and artistic proficiency may be relevant, an overall assessment of the candidate’s qualifications in both these aspects is carried out.  An adjunct position means having a position at Chalmers for maximum 40% of full time. However, it is not an employment relationship; the candidate continues to be employed by their main employer. This means that there is no salary or grant from Chalmers. The first term of office is three years. The parties will then evaluate the experience. It is possible to extend the appointment period on the condition that the agreement with the main employer is renewed. Before an extension beyond a total of six years is made, the trade unions must be informed and given the opportunity to call for negotiations according to § 12 MBL.. An adjunct at Chalmers may not be employed at another higher education institution or university, or at any company within the Chalmers sphere',\n",

This guiding principle has been revised based on the previous version C 2017 -1318.  \\n\\nRole and task of departmental advisory teams  \\nEach department at Chalmers must have a departmental advisory team. The purpose of this team is to provide support to the Head of Department and departmental management. The team has an \\nadvisory role without decision -making tasks. The departmental advisory team must identify and \\ntake a stand on overall strategic issues of importance to Chalmers, the department’s long -term \\ndevelopment and other matters of principle. The departmental advisory team must monitor the \\ndepartment’s development and follow up on the operational plan, results attained and budgetary outcome.  \\nThe team should also support the departmental management in discussing the latter’s responsibility for education, which at Chalmers constitutes delivering and designing courses for programmes via the purchasing organisation. The department’s responsibility includes developing \\nthe quality of the courses but also proposing course development when the subject area is \\ndeveloped.  \\nThe work must be based on the overall Chalmers vision and objectives des cribed in Prioritised \\nOperational Development, which is updated annually. The department’s work must be part of developing Chalmers as a whole.  \\nIn the recruitment of a Head of Department, the departmental advisory team appoints one of its \\nmembers to be a representative to the recruitment group, in accordance with guiding principles for \\nrecruiting managers and leaders (C 2016 -1619, revised in 2018).',\n",

Company formed or licensing  - If there is found to be commercial pot ential, the research \\nteam will form a company based on the patent application where Chalmers Ventures takes a \\nminority ownership of the company. The patent application and the invention are then \\ntransferred to the company.  \\n2. No company formation  - If no company is formed, the researcher is offered the opportunity \\nto buy back the patent application for the actual costs that Chalmers Ventures has incurred, \\ni.e. the total amount of external invoices paid by Chalmers Ventures for the patent \\napplication  with no other costs added. If the researcher (s) declines, the patent application \\nwill be dropped and will eventually cease to  be in force. Unless a new agreement is signed, \\nChalmers has the right to terminate the patent i.e. Chalmers Ventures has no obli gation to \\nincur additional costs on the patent.  \\nThe two scenarios, company formation /licensing  or no  company formation , are based on market and \\napplicable tax rules. In this way, costs for administration and time from business developers within \\nChalmers are covered.  \\n\\nRoute  2.   The individual as a private person owns the patent and therefore responsibility \\nfor administration, risks and additional costs . \\nIf the researcher and Chalmers Ventures consider that collaboration on the patent is not relevant, \\nther e is the possibility for the researcher to stand as the owner of the patent themselves. Invoices \\npertaining to the patent funded by Chalmers must be reported for taxation as a benefit in kind, \\nwhich is handled at an institution according to the Chalmers re gulations. The salary cost premium \\nthat is added is handled by the institution. A Financial Officer at an institution should be contacted in \\nthat case. In the event that several inventors own the patent, each Chalmers employee shall be \\nresponsible for thei r own share of the costs for the taxable benefit in kind. The researcher then \\nmanages the administration themselves and takes responsibility for risks and extra costs that may \\narise afterwards, this is not done by Chalmers.   \\n\\n3.

Educational and pedagogical qualifications must be presented in a pedagogical portfolio. The portfolio is a dynamic document that is updated with experiences, reflections and completed educational activities.  For positions that involve responsibility for examinations in undergraduate education (the Bachelor and Master levels), applicants must have been educated in higher education pedagogics in accordance with SUHF’s recommendations (REK 2016:1) or equivalent education for a total of at least 10 weeks of full-time study (400 hours/15 higher education credits). Since 2017, the supervision course is not recognized as part of the education in higher education pedagogy and thus cannot be counted in the 15 higher education credits. Exceptions may be made for external recruitment, but applicants are then required to undergo education in higher education pedagogics comprising at least 10 weeks of full-time study during the first two years of employment. Responsibility for examinations also requires an approved pedagogical assessment and a lecture and interview in the Faculty Appointment Committee.  Chalmers’s regulations for planning and conducting first cycle and second cycle courses and examinations indicate who may be appointed as an examiner in the Bachelor and Master levels.  If a position includes only teaching and not responsibility for examinations, the applicant is required to have completed an introductory course in higher education pedagogics, equivalent to at least 2 weeks of full-time study (80 hours/3 higher education credits). Exceptions may be made for external recruitment, but applicants are then required to attend an introductory course in higher education pedagogics equivalent to least 3 higher education credits during the first year of employment.   For positions involving primary supervision of doctoral students, applicants are required to have completed research supervision education equivalent to at least 2 weeks of full-time study (80 hours/3 higher education credits).

Decision taken by the President \\non 2021 -06-23. \\nWork environment and workspace  \\nAccording to the Work Environment Act, it is the employer’s responsibility to ensure that employees do not become injured or ill because of their work. The employer must investigate and assess the \\nrisks to the work environment and has a duty to cooperate with the employee to create a good work \\nenvironment, even when an employee works remotely. It is, in turn, the employee’s responsibility, to \\ncooperate with their employer. As the employer’s ability  to detect, manage and remedy work \\nenvironment problems is limited when employees work remotely, cooperation is essential when they do so. The discussion must cover physical, psychosocial, and organisational aspects of the work environment, and the employee must report any work environment problems that arise.  \\nAs the employer does not control the physical location of remote work, the requirements imposed on the employer for the design of the physical conditions of a remote workplace are not the same as \\nfor the main workplace. As remote work is voluntary, both for the employer and the employee, the \\nemployee cannot make as extensive demands in terms of the physical work environment. However, \\nit is still important that the design and layout of the workplace is appropriate from a work \\nenvironment point of view in order to prevent ill health.  Chalmers does not compensate employees for the acquisition, design, or maintenance of their \\nremote workspace.   \\nLearn more about work environment issues on Chalmers’ intranet  and the Swedish Work \\nEnvironment Authority’s website.  \\n\\nInsurance coverage  \\nAll employees are covered by occupational injury insurance, which also applies to remote work. However, occupational injury insurance only applies to accidents related to work. This  means that \\nthe employee is responsible for having adequate home and accident insurance to cover any incurred \\ninjuries that are not related to their work. Injuries that occur through the employee’s own fault and \\nnegligence in the scope of their employment are covered by a liability insurance policy that is \\nincluded in Chalmers’ company insurance, which covers and provides compensation for such injuries.  \\n\\nFollow -up \\nRemote work follow -up takes place on regular basis, during annual appraisal talks or when requested \\nby the employer or the employee.',\n",

They \\nhighlight both what is good what is less good in the bachelor's thesis. The oral opposition is \\nassessed individually, but the opposing group has to prepare their opposition together and \\nduring the opposition session the group members have to cooperate in asking questions and \\ndiscussing the bachelor's thesis. \\nThe purpose of the opposition is to clarify and anchor the content of the essay/report and to \\nmake any supplementary points that are required to make the discussion relevant to \\neveryone in the room. To make the opposition work in an auditorium it is of the utmost \\nimportance that the opponents do not situate the discussion at a detailed level. \\nWritten opposition \\nThe written individual opposition involves a review that sheds light on and discusses the \\nmerits and deficiencies of the essay/report. It has to shed light on and discuss the content of \\nthe report. The text itself has to be a free-standing document, 400-600 words long, in which \\ncomments have been worked on and summarised in a readily accessible way. The following \\npoints can serve as a basis for the review: \\n• The organisation and structure of the essay/report \\n• Definition of the problem \\n• Method/implementation \\n• Scope \\n• Theory \\n• Analysis \\n• Results and handling of results \\n• Design and formal aspects of the essay/report \\nAssessment of the opposition \\nBoth the written and the oral contributions are assessed by the examiner. A well- conducted \\noral opposition is characterised by relevant questions, the follow-up of questions and the \\nability to create a context for the auditorium. The opposition has to be opened and closed in \\na well-considered way and its content has to be well-adapted to the communication \\nsituation.

There must be no conflict of interest between the experts, the candidate and the department. Qualifications in research (science) and education (pedagogy) are assessed by external experts. The scientific and pedagogical experts must be selected from outside Chalmers with the ambition that they should not be a single-sex group, and that at least one of the scientific experts must be active outside the Nordic region. A person appointed as an academic expert must have attained at least the level of the position the assessment concerns. Experts proposed by the department must be approved by the Faculty Appointment Committee, or by the Chair of the Faculty Appointment Committee.   The experts’ report must include a review of the candidate’s activities, an assessment of the quality and results of the candidate’s work and a detailed assessment of whether the candidate meets the qualification requirements for the position. Experts may attend the meetings of the Faculty Appointment Committee and take part in its deliberations, if necessary, but they do not take part in decisions.  Qualifications in the field of utilisation are assessed by the Faculty Appointment Committee, where necessary with the assistance of the vice head of department for utilisation, innovation advisors or contacts within the Chalmers innovation ecosystem. Academic citizenship qualifications are also assessed by the Faculty Appointment Committee, if necessary with the assistance of the department’s research committee.  Position Expert assessment Full Professor For recruitment or promotion to full professor, (at least) three scientific experts and (at least) one pedagogical expert are responsible for reviewing the candidate’s qualifications.   The same pedagogical expertise is required for professor and full professor. Consequently, the pedagogical expert assessment, for promotion from professor to full professor, may be omitted if a pedagogical expert outside Chalmers was responsible for the review for promotion or recruitment to professor',\n",

See also Guidelines and process for recruitment and assessment of assistant professors (C 2023-0348).    15.5\\tOther\\tinternal\\trecruitments\\tInternal recruitment of permanent faculty is also possible between position categories, provided that the co-worker meets the qualification requirements for the new position. Internal recruitment between position categories requires a decision by the President, and the process is managed by the Faculty Appointment Committee with an expert review, an interview and a lecture. For example, this may involve the internal recruitment from senior researcher to associate professor. This assumes that the person has been admitted as an oavlönad docent and has the other qualifications for an associate professorship. The Faculty Appointment Committee can review both the oavlönad docent title and the associate professor position at the same time.  However, the step from senior lecturer to associate professor is called promotion (please see Chapter 15.3.1).  15.6\\tAcceptance\\tas\\t“oavlönad\\tdocent”\\tChalmers may accept persons from within and outside the university to the academic title of “oavlönad docent”. The requirements are that the applicant must have proven themselves to be an independent researcher, with a scientific expertise that is significantly higher than what is required for a doctoral degree, and to have met the requirements for pedagogical qualifications. The academic title “oavlönad docent” should not be confused with the permanent position of associate professor, see Chapter 6.3.  To be accepted as oavlönad docent, a clear connection to Chalmers is required. Applicants from outside Chalmers may, for example, have a long-standing collaboration, in research or doctoral studies, with a department at Chalmers.  15.6',\n",

Guiding principle for financing of patents where \\nChalmers administrates the funding  \\n\\n1. Background \\nThese guidelines are to ensure researchers receive suitable, clear, and correct support for patents \\nthat are financed with external funding administered by Chalmers University of Technology AB. They \\nalso ensure standardi sed practices across the entire organi sation, both within departments as well as \\nelsewhere in the Chalmers group.  \\nThe initi al premise is that ownership and management of the invention, which has not been \\ntransferred to another party, entails a private expense for the researcher or researchers who, under \\nthe teacher's ex emption , developed an invention that forms the basis for a  patent application. \\nExternal financiers can make additional grants to cover patent costs in conjunction with research \\nprojects at Chalmers. When Chalmers is the administering organi sation for these grants, i .e. the \\nmoney is paid out and handled in Chalmer s system, it means that the regulations on tax benefits, \\nstate aid, gift to employees, and consideration for the teacher exemption must be complied with.  \\nThe goal of patents is primarily to commerciali se results , and  the assignment to support this process \\nwithin the Chalmers Group is owned by Chalmers Ventures. In this context, the function of the \\nInnovation Office is support and advise researchers correctly through the process.  \\n\\n2. Possible routes  \\nFor researchers that will create growth companies based on business ideas built on research results \\nthere is the possibility to do this together with the Chalmers’ subsidiary company Chalmers Ventures. \\nAlternatively, researchers may manage the patent and commerciali sation  themselves.

Decision by Vice \\nPresident of Undergraduate Education and Lifelong learning \\n16Annex 3 Instructions for the planning report\\nThe planning report has to give a clear statement of the subject/problem the bachelor’s \\nthesis will deal with, and how this will be done. The following headings and information \\nmust always be included. Note that the following headings must be included irrespective of \\nwhether the study is wholly literature-based, contains an empirical investigation or is a \\ndesign project. The planning report does not need to answer all of the following questions, \\nbut the students should consider these issues at an early stage in the project and \\nconsistently cover more and more of them. It is a good idea for the students and supervisor \\nto exchange a number of drafts of the planning report before it is submitted.\\nTitle\\nA preliminary title has to be given in the planning report\\nBackground\\nThe background has to contain reasons why the subject chosen is of interest from an \\nacademic perspective and/or from an engineering perspective or, where relevant, from the \\nperspective of the customer/client. In certain cases, this heading has to include a brief \\nhistory of the subject. After reading the background all readers should understand why the \\nsubject is relevant. The following issues should be considered:\\nWhat is the subject/problem to be examined? Why has the subject/problem come up? Why \\nor for whom is it an interesting or relevant subject/problem? Can the specific \\nsubject/problem be related to a more general discussion?\\nAim\\nThe aim specifies what the project is intended to result in and what type of results will be \\nachieved. A project can have several different aims that are related to the subjects/problems \\npresented in the background. In most cases, however, it is appropriate to only have a \\ngeneral aim, which is then broken down into more detailed parts further on in the process \\nand essay/report in the bachelor’s thesis.\\nProblem/Task\\nThis section is often the most important part of the planning report (and of the final \\nessay/report). It aims to identify the question(s) to be raised in the project. It is important\",\n",

Chalmers has a \\nlow proportion of women in senior faculty positions. Traditionally, Chalmers’ culture and areas of research have been male dominated, which entails a risk that competent employees, most of all \\nwomen, may prefer other employers to Chalmers. The recruitment processes for top researchers \\nneed to be strictly meritocratic.  \\nA systematic approach to recruitment and promotion processes, such as broad open advertisements for positions, is one way to change this, but it is also necessary to ensure that the gender balance in \\noperational support also improves. The work is carried o ut through Genie with a clear link to HR, \\ncentral management and heads of department. The culture and health and safety need to be worked \\non throughout the organisation. The responsibility lies with all line managers.  \\nAttracting and developing faculty  \\nThe faculty we have and would like to employ is coveted by the university community and other sectors alike. We need to offer attractive conditions for really good employees to stay at Chalmers and for new employees to want to come. We need to work to offer good conditions in terms of a high percentage of base funding, modern infrastructure, a high -quality research and teaching \\nenvironment, and access to good partnerships with external partners and talented students to teach.  \\nInternational attractiveness  \\nGiven the global nature of the contexts in which Chalmers wants to improve its position to make a better contribution to a better world, its international attractiveness needs to increase. This is about \\nhow Chalmers as a whole is  perceived by outsiders, who may have widely differing perceptions of \\nwhat is attractive, all of which need to be considered and addressed.

       "  '1. Introduction  \\nIt is very important for Chalmers’ operations to have active student influence, with students who \\nhelp make the education, research, utilisation and educational administration at Chalmers world -\\nclass. With students who exert real influence and feel that their opinions are taken seriously, \\nChalmers is able to continue to develop.  \\n\\n1.1 Background to the document  \\nThis document has been produced to clarify the purpose and objectives of active student \\ninfluence a t Chalmers and also to show clearly where students and doctoral students are \\nrepresented in Chalmers’ preparatory and decision -making bodies, with influence over \\neducation -related issues. The Student Union and Chalmers jointly drew up the document \\nGuidelin es for student influence in autumn 2011. The guidelines must be reviewed by Chalmers \\nand the Student Union together. The review is best performed every year in the spring semester. \\nIn addition, Chalmers and the Student Union must maintain a continuous dial ogue and monitor \\nhow well student influence functions.  \\n\\n1.2 Purpose and objectives of active student influence  \\nThe purpose of active student influence at Chalmers is for educational activities to develop and \\nimprove constantly through the joint efforts and  collaboration of the university and the students. A \\nnumber of studies show clearly that there is a positive correlation between strong student influence \\nand high educational quality1. According to the Appointment regulation for first cycle and second \\ncycle education (undergraduate and Master’s education) at Chalmers, the students are entitled to \\nexert influence in education -related issues.   \\n\\nThe objective of active student influence is for the students’ views to help develop Chalmers’ \\nmanagement  and design of undergraduate education, courses, programmes and the learning \\nenvironment as a whole. Student influence is a natural part of Chalmers’ wider task to promote \\ndemocracy, fairness and equality and supports Chalmers’ vision: Chalmers for a susta inable future.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1 Including the Swedish National Audit Office’s RiR 2008:19 High quality in higher education? and government \\nbill 1999/2000:28 Student influence and quality improvement in higher education institutions',\n",

       "  'Freedom of action and funding system  \\nSeveral factors currently limit the independence and freedom of action of the university to perform its assignment with a high level of quality. The external environment reduces the scope for \\nuniversities to make autonomous, independent, critical choices about issues in education and \\nresearch. The trend towards increased political regulation of universities’ assignments and short -\\nterm governance models from different funding bodies is a growing challenge at systemic level. It dilutes independent research, w hich is not a long- term strategy for high academic quality.  \\nHealth and safety and the environment for students and employees  \\nHealth and safety surveys show that many people find their environment stressful, with fragmented working hours for researchers and teachers and insufficient recovery time for students. There is a need to strengthen both leadership and employeeship and phy sical and social environments that \\ntogether support and stimulate the development of academic activities for both employees and students. Chalmers does not have sufficient resources to develop high -quality environments in \\nseveral locations and therefore ne eds to develop a single campus for all Chalmers programmes, \\ndepartments, teachers and students with a shared culture. Moving operations to Johanneberg means \\nbetter working conditions in the long term, but in the short term it may lead to increased workload s \\nand the risk of deterioration in the physical and psychosocial working environment.  \\nOrganisation \\nThe risk relating to the complexity of the organisation may be linked to the above arguments about \\nhealth and safety.

       "  'Introduction This policy document describes the rules that apply at Chalmers tekniska högskola AB (referred to subsequently as Chalmers) for contract education and other paid education that is not higher education.  Contract education at state universities and higher education institutions is governed by the Ordinance (2002:760) on contract education at higher education institutions. Further provisions are contained in the Swedish Council for Higher Education’s regulations (UHRFS 2013:11) on contract education at higher education institutions. As an independent higher education provider, Chalmers is not subject to these regulations. Chalmers has chosen to regulate contract education through this policy document. Chalmers’ guidelines also include other paid education, for which there is no equivalent in the regulations for state higher education institutions. This policy document describes: - Definitions and limitations for contract education and other paid education, - the principles that these forms of education should follow; and - organisation and responsibility for these forms of education.  Definitions and limitations Contract education and other paid education is organised for a fee and is distinct from higher education, which includes both undergraduate education, which provides higher education credits and is financed by the state or by tuition fees for international students outside Europe, and doctoral programmes. Chalmers provides contract education and other paid education only in the form of courses and not in the form of degree programmes. Chalmers applies the same definition for contract education as the Ordinance on contract education at higher education institutions (2002:760); ‘The term higher education institution is to refer below to both a university or a university college and the term contract education to programmes of study that are arranged for a fee to be paid by some entity other than a natural person. Such education must relate to staff education that is likely to have an impact on the participants’ work for the client or education needed for labour market reasons. If it is a public sector client, it may also include other staff education or education needed for development policy reasons. The contract may concern education for persons who are not employed by the client if the education is to be provided on behalf of the Swedish state for a specific category of persons following a government decision. As for the actual implementation of contract education, it may be provided with or without higher education credits',\n",

Decision by the \\nPresident  2023 -04-24. \\nGood management of research data  \\nIntroduction  \\nDigital research data is becoming increasingly important in research, both as a resource and as a \\nresult. Data is produced and used more frequently and in increasing quantities. Good management of research data thus  becomes a cornerstone in the continued assurance of high research quality. \\nEffective research data management also results in more efficient research. Data can be more easily \\nfound, reviewed, shared, cited,  and reused. To  utilise  available opportunities, researchers need to \\nmake active choices to manage research data effectively and efficiently during all phases of research \\nactivities. Additionally , research principals and researchers together need to ensure that the \\nmanagement of research data takes place  in accordance with relevant laws, regulations,  and \\ninstructions.  \\nStarting point  \\nResearch data is an important asset and is a prerequisite for Chalmers\\' activities. Research data must be documented, managed,  and protected so that they are available and usable when needed. Data \\nshall not be altered or destroyed unintentionally , and access to it shall be controlled within the \\nrelevant laws, rules,  and conditions.  \\nDefinition of research data  \\nThe rules presented below apply to research data in a broad sense, i.e. digital information created or \\ncollected to be analysed  for research purposes, according to the Swedish Research Council\\'s \\ndefinition:1 \\n\"Research data can be of many different types and formats, such as results from measurements and experiments, obse rvations from fieldwork, survey responses, interviews, images, film, and texts. \\nResearch data can also be of different levels of analysis, degree of processing and compilation.\"  \\nResponsibilities  \\nChalmers University of Technology is responsible for creating the conditions such that : \\n• the research is  able to comply with legal requirements and the rules below and with the \\nrequirements set by research funders and other research stakeholders , \\n• the research is offered access to and support for infrastructure for st oring, managing,  and \\nsharing research data during and after the implementation of a research activity ,  \\n• the research is offered access to relevant knowledge about good research practice, practices \\nfor good management of research data, and relevant requirem ents in laws, regulations,  and \\nguidelines.  \\n\\n1 https://www.vr.se/download/18.ad27632166e0b1efab1cdc/1555322024158/Kriterier -FAIR -\\nforskningsdata_VR_2018.pdf',\n",

It means that, as a university of technology \\nand science, our mission is to produce, maintain and spread knowledge, expertise and \\nsolutions to achieve an open, sustainable society in Sweden and worldwide. To succeed in achieving our objectives, it is essential for Chalmers to attract highly motivated students , \\nwith good prior knowledge, and outstanding teachers and researchers.

Introduction\\nThe Local Qualifications Framework for first and second cycle qualifications is based on the Act \\n(1993:792) concerning authority to award certain qualifications in the first and second cycles, with \\neffect from 1 July 2007. The Act (1993:792) concerning authority to award certain qualifications \\nstates that the education shall follow requirements of education stipulated in Chapter 1 of the \\nSwedish Higher Education Act (1992:1434) and in the National Qualifications Ordinance, Annex 2 of \\nthe Higher Education Ordinance (1993:100). Beyond qualifications listed in Annex 2 there are also \\nadditional provisions in the following ordinances that must be fulfilled for secondary teaching \\nqualifications at first and second level; Ordinance on supplementary teacher education (2011:686) \\nleading to secondary teaching qualifications, as well as Ordinance on education for qualification as a \\nteacher/pre-school teacher (2021:1335) leading to secondary teaching qualifications. The \\nqualification descriptors above are presented in this local qualification framework per qualification \\ntogether with the complimentary local degree requirements (qualifications descriptors) which have \\nbeen decided by Chalmers University of Technology.\\nOn 28 June 2007, the Government decided that with effect from 1 July 2007 Chalmers University of \\nTechnology AB (”Chalmers”) will be entitled to award the qualifications specified in this local \\nqualifications framework (Government decisions U2006/9375/UH, U2007/4718/UH). \\nOn 10 February 2011, the Government decided that Chalmers will be entitled to award the Degree \\nof Master of Science in Secondary Education with a specialisation in teaching in the upper secondary \\nschool in the subjects of mathematics, chemistry and physics and engineering (Government decision \\nU2010/4017/UH). \\nOn 2 October 2011, the Government decided that Chalmers will be entitled to award the Degree of \\nBachelor of Science in Secondary Education with a specialisation in teaching in the upper secondary',\n",

Adopted by the University Board on 26 April  2023.  \\n49 \\n  \\nProposed promotions are first discussed in the departments’ management and research committees and included in the annual operational planning. The department’s research \\ncommittee makes an internal, expert assessment of which candidates that meet the \\nquali fication requirements for the relevant level of position in accordance with the rules of \\nprocedure. The head of department is ultimately responsible for ensuring that the candidate \\nmeets all formal requirements.

Each new assistant professor \\nat Chalmers must be a strategic recruitment with the aim of transferring to the permanent \\nposition of associate professor, provided that the mid -term assessment and the scientific \\nand pedagogical expert reviews are approved. This transition from a fixed -term position to \\na permanent position at Chalmers is referred to as internal recruitment, and the qualification \\nrequirements are the same as for external recruitment to an associate professor position. \\nThe process of internal recruitment is managed by the Faculty Appointment Committee \\n(after acceptance of the academic title oavlönad docent) with an interview and a lecture. \\nSee also Guidelines and process for recruitment and assessment of assistant professors (C \\n2015/1926).',\n",
